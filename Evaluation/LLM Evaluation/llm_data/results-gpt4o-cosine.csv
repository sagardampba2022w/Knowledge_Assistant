Regression and classification are both types of predictive modeling techniques, but they serve different purposes and are used in different situations. 

- **Regression:** This type of model is used when the goal is to predict a continuous outcome or numerical value. For example, forecasting sales figures, predicting market demand, or estimating consumer spending. Regression models analyze the relationships between dependent and independent variables to generate numerical predictions.

- **Classification:** This type of model is used when the goal is to predict a categorical outcome or class label. For example, classifying customers into different segments, determining whether a customer will buy a product or not, or identifying whether a transaction is fraudulent. Classification models assign data points to predefined categories based on the input features.
