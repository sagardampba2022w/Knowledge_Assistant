Classification is a supervised learning technique where the model is trained using historical data with labeled outcomes to predict categorical labels for new data points. For example, it might be used to categorize emails as 'spam' or 'not spam'.

Clustering, on the other hand, is an unsupervised learning technique. It groups data points into clusters based on similarities without predefined labels. The goal of clustering is to discover inherent groupings in data, such as segmenting consumers based on behavior or preferences without prior knowledge of those groups.

In summary, classification involves predicting specific outcomes based on trained data, while clustering identifies patterns and groups in the data without prior labels.","Machine learning models can be set up by selecting the data you want to analyze, choosing the type of model you want to use, such as classification or clustering, and training the model using historical data.",c95364eb,Can you explain the difference between classification and clustering in machine learning models?,Advanced Analytics and Predictive Modeling,Can you explain the difference between classification and clustering in machine learning models?,Advanced Analytics and Predictive Modeling,c95364eb
